# Proj
Version 1.0
Just a prototype with no gui but all core classes
only adopts simple sequencial algorithm for storing data
In this version, we developed a prototype of this information system, which simulates a client and a server.
It simulates some basic functions such as 'login', 'upload contents', 'register' or 'suggestions'
Due to its purpose, which is for demonstration, only the simplies algorithms are adopted and no gui is developed.
